And I unsent it.</p><p class='paragraph delay-2' style='text-align:center'>Not because it wasn't true, but because I wasn't brave enough to let you see that side of me.</p><div class='memory-card delay-3' style='border-color:rgba(136,19,55,.7);background:rgba(0,0,0,.55)'><p class='memory-text' style='font-size:1.18rem;color:#c0c0c0;line-height:2;font-style:italic'>About the day I opened up to you? I was reading my own texts and I didn't recognize my own words. I read them one by one and I cried.</p><p class='memory-text' style='font-size:1.18rem;color:#c0c0c0;line-height:2;font-style:italic'>I was like damn... this is so sad. Why can't my brain accept that it's me? That these were my own texts?</p><p class='memory-text' style='font-size:1.18rem;color:#c0c0c0;line-height:2;font-style:italic'>I have NEVER talked about this to anyone so clearly. But I guess opening up works better when you don't think, when you just open your heart and revisit the past.</p><p class='memory-text' style='font-size:1.18rem;color:#c0c0c0;line-height:2;font-style:italic'>I am starting to realize the one big problem I have is I do anything to protect myself. Even in front of a therapist.</p><p class='memory-text' style='font-size:1.18rem;color:#c0c0c0;line-height:2;font-style:italic'>I would twist my story in a way so I get what I want, so she knows as little as possible, so I can just get it over with. I admit I should have been completely honest. But I wasn't. I felt proud that I manipulated the situation. And that scared me.</p><p class='memory-text' style='font-size:1.18rem;color:#c0c0c0;line-height:2;font-style:italic'>What is wrong with me? Why do I manipulate? Why do I hurt people without realizing? What's the problem and I will fix it I swear. Just tell me what's wrong with me.</p></div><p class='paragraph delay-4' style='text-align:center'>When I reread that message, I cried. Not because I am evil. But because I finally saw how much I had been protecting myself.</p><p class='paragraph delay-5' style='text-align:center;font-style:italic'>The therapist explanation is simple: When vulnerability feels dangerous, control feels safer.</p><div class='quote-box delay-6'><p class='quote-text'>It wasn't that I was a monster. It was that I was scared of being fully seen and rejected. I didn't send that message because I wasn't ready. But I am now.</p></div></div></div>
