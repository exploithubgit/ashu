            <p class="unsent-intro delay-1">There is something I wrote one night. And I unsent it.</p>
            <p class="unsent-intro delay-2">Not because it wasn't true. But because I wasn't brave enough to let you see that side of me.</p>

            <div class="unsent-message">
                <p class="unsent-text delay-3">About the day I opened up to you? I was reading my own texts and I didn't recognize my own words. I read them one by one and I cried.</p>

                <p class="unsent-text delay-4">I was like damn... this is so sad. Why can't my brain accept that it's me? That these were my own texts?</p>

                <p class="unsent-text delay-5">I have NEVER talked about this to anyone so clearly. But I guess opening up works better when you don't think, when you just open your heart and revisit the past.</p>

                <p class="unsent-text delay-6">I am starting to realize the one big problem I have is I do anything to protect myself. Even in front of a therapist.</p>

                <p class="unsent-text delay-7">I would twist my story in a way so I get what I want, so she knows as little as possible, so I can just get it over with.</p>

                <p class="unsent-text delay-8">I admit I should have been completely honest. But I wasn't.</p>

                <p class="unsent-text" style="animation-delay: 1.8s">I felt proud that I manipulated the situation. And that scared me.</p>

                <p class="unsent-text" style="animation-delay: 2s">What is wrong with me? Why do I manipulate? Why do I hurt people without realizing? What's the problem and I will fix it I swear. Just tell me what's wrong with me.</p>

            <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center; color: var(--rose-300); font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 2rem; animation-delay: 2.2s">When I reread that message, I cried.</p>

            <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center; animation-delay: 2.4s">Not because I am evil. But because I finally saw how much I had been protecting myself.</p>

            <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; animation-delay: 2.6s">The therapist explanation is simple: When vulnerability feels dangerous, control feels safer.</p>

            <div class="revelation" style="animation-delay: 2.8s">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">It wasn't that I was a monster.<br>It was that I was scared of being fully seen and rejected.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">I didn't send that message because I wasn't ready.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.8rem; color: var(--rose-400); font-weight: bold;">But I am now.</p>
