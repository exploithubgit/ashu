            <p class="paragraph delay-1">I rushed us.</p>

            <p class="paragraph delay-2">I should have worked on myself more. I should have built us slower. I should have opened up fully instead of protecting parts of myself.</p>

            <p class="paragraph delay-3">When you went quiet for days because you were going through a hard time, my mind didn't think, "She's struggling."</p>

            <p class="paragraph delay-5">So that morning I sent that message saying maybe we should break up. Not because I wanted to leave. But because I was scared.</p>

            <p class="paragraph delay-6">Scared of being abandoned. Scared of being alone again. Scared of losing the one person who made me feel like myself.</p>

            <p class="paragraph delay-7">When you replied the next day, especially when you said you were glad I double texted, something inside me calmed down.</p>

            <span class="highlight delay-8">In 23 years of my life, no one had ever made me feel as safe to be myself as you did.</span>
