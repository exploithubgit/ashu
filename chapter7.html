Not at you. At the system.</p><p>Nobody stood up for you. Not teachers. Not friends. And when you told me on video call and cried, I felt helpless. I wanted to protect you, but I couldn't.</p><p>Part of me wished you handled it differently. But you are kind. You are never mean. And I would never want you to become like him just to survive.</p><p>I know you think it's only a few weeks left and you can get through it, and that gives me some relief. But you also need to stand up for yourself. You will meet people like him in life, and your boundaries matter.</p></div><div class='callout'><p>I am angry at the system because it can make kind people hurt and absorb pain. But there is nothing wrong with your kindness. If the world makes a kind person mean, that would be the saddest thing.</p><p>I hope you find people who respect your boundaries. I hope you love yourself enough that no one's negativity can touch you, not even mine.</p></div></div></div>
