Not loud. Not trying too hard. Just... real.</p><p class='paragraph delay-3'>And I remember the strangest thought — I wanted to buy you jhumkas.</p><p class='paragraph delay-4'>I don't even know why. It just felt like that was how I wanted to express your beauty. Like words weren't enough.</p><div class='quote-box delay-5'><p class='quote-text'>Then you wrote that you were a "closed book waiting for the right person to read." And something in me paused. I didn't feel challenged. I didn't feel competitive. I felt understood.</p></div><p class='paragraph delay-6'>I saw myself in that sentence. I am a closed book too.</p><p class='paragraph delay-7'>I didn't want to rush you like people rush things on dating apps. I wanted to build something slowly. Calmly. Properly.</p><p class='paragraph delay-8'>You were different. Smart. Kind. Balanced. You had boundaries but you were never mean. You weren't frustrated or impatient. You were thoughtful.</p><span class='highlight' style='animation-delay:1.8s'>Talking to you felt safe. And that safety... I didn't even realize how rare it was until later.</span></div></div>
