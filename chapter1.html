            <p class="paragraph delay-1">When I first saw your profile on Boo, it was that selfie in front of your old MacBook. You looked so cute. Not loud. Not trying too hard. Just... real.</p>

            <p class="paragraph delay-2">And I remember the strangest thought, I wanted to buy you jhumkas. I don't even know why. It just felt like that was how I wanted to express your beauty. Like words weren't enough.</p>

            <div class="quote-box delay-3">
                <p class="quote-text">You wrote that you were a closed book waiting for the right person to read. And something in me paused. I didn't feel challenged. I didn't feel competitive. I felt understood.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph delay-4">I saw myself in that sentence. I am a closed book too.</p>

            <p class="paragraph delay-5">I didn't want to rush you like people rush things on dating apps. I wanted to build something slowly. Calmly. Properly.</p>

            <p class="paragraph delay-6">You were different. Smart. Kind. Balanced. You had boundaries but you were never mean. You weren't frustrated or impatient. You were thoughtful.</p>

            <span class="highlight delay-7">Talking to you felt safe. And that safety... I didn't even realize how rare it was until later.</span>
